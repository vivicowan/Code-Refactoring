# Code-Refactoring
  
## Creating a more accesible Horiseon Digital Marketing webpage. 
  
- The motivation behind this task was to ensure that the Horiseon Marketing Agency increased efficiency with their webpage. 
- I took on this project to help the Agency have a code base that meets accessibility standards. 
- By refactoring the code of the webpage, the Agency gains an improved codebase for long-term sustainability.
- With this task, I learned how to sufficiently optimize and organize HTML and CSS.
  
## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

# Code-Refactoring
  
## Creating a more accesible Horiseon Digital Marketing webpage. 
  
- The motivation behind this task was to ensure that the Horiseon Marketing Agency increased efficiency with their webpage. 
- I took on this project to help the Agency have a code base that meets accessibility standards. 
- By refactoring the code of the webpage, the Agency gains an improved codebase for long-term sustainability.
- With this task, I learned how to sufficiently optimize and organize HTML and CSS.
